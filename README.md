# 👋 Salaam, I'm Houssem – Architect of Code & Life

**Developer. Automator. Self-Hoster. Minimalist.**

I don’t just build software — I build systems. From DevOps pipelines to healthy routines, my life is in beta and I’m loving the iteration.

---

## 🛠️ Projects I'm Crafting

🌀 **CI/CD Self-Hosted Stack**  
Push to Git → Trigger `n8n` → Analyze via `SonarQube` → Deploy via Docker + `Harbor` → Monitor everything with Grafana.  
_📦 Full open-source control. Zero vendor lock-in._

🌿 **Balcony Garden Dashboard**  
Growing food in 1.5m² of sunlight?  
Why not automate watering, track plant growth, and visualize yield on Grafana? (Work in progress…)

🧠 **Qur’an Memorization Tracker**  
Weekly surahs, spaced repetition, and Sunday reviews.  
A tool to track progress, Tajweed focus, and spiritual growth.
